Welcome to the ⊔ [SquareCup] Language Project !
==========================================

⊔ is a proposal for a 'Universal Short Sparse Graph Language'


Warning: The code has been ported to Python3 for a better support to unicode. All the doc is under refactoring. 
This is a 'just one file' [Open-source](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/COPYING) project, easy to use, easy to share!


All is included or generated from the [u.py](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.py) file.


Launch that Python file to pass tests and to generate formated documentation.


You can use it as a Python module and overload functions.


Or use it as a Web service...for [instance](http://pi.pelinquin.fr/u?about).  


Enjoy!
