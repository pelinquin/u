Welcome to the ⊔ [SquareCup] Language Project !
====================================

⊔ is the 'Universal Short Graphical Language'


This is a 'just one file' [Open-source](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/COPYING) project, easy to use, easy to share!


All is included or generated from the [u.py](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.py) file.


Launch that Python file to pass tests and to generate formated documentation.


Or use it as a Web service...for [instance](https://193.84.73.209/u?about).  
For your convenience, the [u.pdf](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.pdf?raw=true) file is also commited.

Enjoy!
