fkht6: [u.py](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.py) base64 encoded sha1 short digest

Welcome to the ⊔ [SquareCup] Language Project !
==========================================

⊔ is a proposal for a 'Universal Short Graph Language'


Warning: The current project is under transition to Python3 for a better support to unicode. All the doc is also refactored. 
The u3.py file will replace u.py file when all porting details will be fixed.
Our server on Internet does not currently support mod_wsgi for Python3. Need to fix that asap.

This is a 'just one file' [Open-source](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/COPYING) project, easy to use, easy to share!


All is included or generated from the [u.py](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.py) file.


Launch that Python file to pass tests and to generate formated documentation.


You can use it as a Python module and overload functions.


Or use it as a Web service...for [instance](https://193.84.73.209/u?about).  
For your convenience, the [u.pdf](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/u.pdf?raw=true) and [beamer_u.pdf](https://github.com/pelinquin/u/blob/master/beamer_u.pdf?raw=true) files are also commited.

Enjoy!
